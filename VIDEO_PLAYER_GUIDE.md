```

## Features Implemented

### 1. Video Player Component (`VideoPlayerScreen.tsx`)
- **Full-screen video playback** optimized for Android TV
- **Live streaming support** with M3U8/HLS compatibility
- **Touch controls** with auto-hide functionality
- **Error handling** with retry options
- **Loading indicators** during stream buffering
- **Landscape orientation** lock for TV viewing
- **Back navigation** support

### 2. Navigation Flow
- **Categories** → **Channels** → **Video Player**
- Seamless navigation between screens
- Proper state management for video URLs and channel names

### 3. Android TV Optimizations
- **Leanback launcher** support for TV home screen
- **Landscape orientation** by default
- **TV-specific permissions** and features
- **Remote control** compatibility

## How It Works

1. **User selects a category** from the main screen
2. **User selects a channel** from the channel list
3. **App fetches the video URL** from your API
4. **Video player opens** and starts streaming the live content

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `react-native-video`: For video playback functionality
- `react-native-orientation-locker`: For orientation management

### Key Components Modified
- `TVChannelsScreen.tsx`: Added video player navigation
- `ChannelListScreen.tsx`: Integrated video URL fetching and playback
- `VideoPlayerScreen.tsx`: New full-featured video player component

### Android Manifest Updates
- Added network and video playback permissions
- Configured TV-specific features
- Set landscape orientation as default

## Video Player Controls

### Touch Controls
- **Tap screen**: Show/hide controls
- **Back button**: Return to channel list
- **Fullscreen toggle**: Expand/contract video view

### Auto-hide Controls
- Controls automatically hide after 3 seconds of inactivity
- Tap screen to show controls again

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry on stream errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to channel list on persistent errors

## Supported Video Formats

The video player supports various streaming formats including:
- **HLS (M3U8)**: Live streaming format (your use case)
- **DASH**: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming
- **MP4**: Standard video files
- **WebM**: Web video format

## Testing the Video Player

1. **Run the app** on an Android device or emulator
2. **Navigate to a category** and select a channel
3. **The video player will open** and start streaming
4. **Test controls** by tapping the screen
5. **Use back button** to return to channel list

## Performance Considerations

- **Hardware acceleration** enabled for smooth playback
- **Adaptive bitrate streaming** for optimal quality
- **Memory management** to prevent crashes during long viewing sessions
- **Network error recovery** for unstable connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Video not loading**: Check network connectivity and URL validity
2. **Controls not responding**: Ensure touch events are properly handled
3. **App crashes**: Check device memory and close other apps

### Debug Information
- Video errors are logged to console
- Network requests can be monitored in development mode
- Use React Native debugger for detailed troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements you could add:
- **Picture-in-picture mode** for multitasking
- **Subtitle support** for accessibility
- **Video quality selection** for different network conditions
- **Chromecast integration** for casting to other devices
- **Favorites system** for quick access to preferred channels

## API Integration

The video player integrates with your existing API structure:
```typescript
// Your API call in tvChannelsService
const videoUrl = await tvChannelsService.getChannelVideoUrl(categoryName, channelName);

// Video player receives the URL
<VideoPlayerScreen
  videoUrl={videoUrl}
  channelName={channelName}
  onBack={handleBackFromPlayer}
/>
```

Your app is now ready to stream live video content from any M3U8 URL returned by your API!
